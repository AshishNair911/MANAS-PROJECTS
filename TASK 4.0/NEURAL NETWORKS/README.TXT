Dino Tim is impressed by the prowess of your Clustering algorithm, and he is feeling closer to his kin again. But something is missing, mad-scientist David Jijo suggested that Timothy has been neglecting the age-long Dino Tradition - preserving the teeth of his ancestors in their respective town-halls. 

Timothy has the pictures of the teeth samples collected though, the only hurdle is to  classify those pictures as belonging to their respective dinos.

Implementation
The task is to implement a Neural Network from scratch for the teeth dataset given below, Train your model on Jijo's Secret Samples and predict the classes for the samples in Tim's Kins :
