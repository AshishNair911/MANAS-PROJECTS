Lord of the Strides,
Description,
It's that time of the year again, Timothy is excited to see the bunch that has made it to the final task in the preliminary Taskphase and is throwing a party to his fellow friends(the descendants of those whose teeth you classified). But he needs help feeding the right kind of stuff to the right dino, can you help him out?

Implementation

Build a CNN to predict which class the image from the dataset belongs to.,
You are allowed to use torch/tensorflow-keras to build the model, no pretrained models are allowed though.,
Timothy is a visual learner, so he needs to see visualizations like confusion matrices, predictions, and graphs before he can trust your code.

Use the dataset attached to train your CNN, the dataset also contains vacation pictures, make sure to classify them as well .
